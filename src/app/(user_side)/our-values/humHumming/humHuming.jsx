            About the Founder
          </p>

          <p className="md:text-lg mt-4">
            Vessels embodies what I needed during my battle with anxiety and
            deep depression years agoâ€”a brand that understands your process to
            wholeness. Through self-inquiry, I&apos;ve realized the profound
            power of inner healing and realized, in the universal truth of
            oneness. I&apos;m deeply passionate about sharing the NOW Method
            with the world. <br /> Now, as a Meditation teacher, Breathwork
            Facilitator and Integration Coach, I aim to hold space for others as
            they discover this truth within themselves. Acknowledging the self,
            plant medicine, meditation, fasting and breathwork have been pivotal
            in my personal journey, and I believe in their potential for global
            healing.
